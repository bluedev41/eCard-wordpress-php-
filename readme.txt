eCards is a WordPress plugin used to send electronic cards to friends. It can be implemented in a page, a post, a custom post or the sidebar.

There are two ways you can use this plugin:

2. Call the function from a template file: <?php if (function_exists('display_ecardMe')) { echo display_ecardMe(); } ?>;

== Installation ==

1. Upload the wp-ecards folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Create and publish a new page/post and add this shortcode: [ecard]
4. A new eCards menu will appear in WordPress with options, and general help
